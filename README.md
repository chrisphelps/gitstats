# gitstats

A golang CLI client for doing some basic git analysis.

I find I want to do some summary of my github activities from time to time. This client is intended to do some of this analysis by interacting with the github REST API.

Currently this is focused only on github. Future ideas include some direct analysis of a checked-out git repo, and perhaps integrations for gitlab or bitbucket.

This was heavily seeded from [a freeCodeCamp blog post by Peter Benjamin](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/writing-command-line-applications-in-go-2bc8c0ace79d)
